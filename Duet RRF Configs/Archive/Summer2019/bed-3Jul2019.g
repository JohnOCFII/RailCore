;Effect   : 4 point bed homing for the Bl-touch and magnetic bed, probing between magnets.
;Use-case : The BL-touch is affected by magnets. This 4 point bed.g was originally created by Robert Hendricks 
;         ; to probe points in the nulls in the magnetic field.  Updated to meet my coordinates.

;
; Use S-1 for measurements only, without calculations. Use S4 for endstop heights and Z-height only. Use S6 for full 6 factors
; If your Z probe has significantly different trigger heights depending on XY position, adjust the H parameters in the G30 commands accordingly. 
; The value of each H parameter should be (trigger height at that XY position) - (trigger height at centre of bed)
