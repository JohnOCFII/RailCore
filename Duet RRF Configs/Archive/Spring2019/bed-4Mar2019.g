M561                         	; clear any existing bed transform
G1 Z5 S2			; Move hot-end up (bed down) 5

; Probe the bed at 3 points, and perform 3-factor auto compensation
; Before running this, you should have set up your Z-probe trigger height to suit your build, 
; in the G31 command in config.g.
;

G30 P0 X15 Y16 Z-99999		; probe near a leadscrew
G30 P1 X15 Y266 Z-99999		; probe near a leadscrew
G30 P2 X275 Y139 Z-99999 S3 ; probe near a leadscrew and calibrate 3 motors
G1 X5 Y5 F4000            	; move the head to the corner (optional)



; In default config - check for why not in default Railcore configs.
;
; Use S-1 for measurements only, without calculations. Use S4 for endstop heights and Z-height only. Use S6 for full 6 factors
; If your Z probe has significantly different trigger heights depending on XY position, adjust the H parameters in the G30 commands accordingly. The value of each H parameter should be (trigger height at that XY position) - (trigger height at centre of bed)
